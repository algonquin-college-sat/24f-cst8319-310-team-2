### Software Team Project

This repository houses a video game project, alongside any documentation and plans for it. The project itself has been created using phaser.js.
http-server is bundled in the project, so there is no need for you to install the module yourself.

The Diagrams folder contains the wireframe of the project sites as well as sequence diagrams for reference.
The Project folder contains all source code and assets used in the project program.

-- Assets: Contains images and audio that are intended to be utilized in the game project.
-- Scripts: Contains JavaScript code that holds the game logic together. Also contains a 'Scenes' folder that holds different scenes that play within the same page (cutscenes, levels, etc.)
-- Styles: Contains a css file only for use with the project home page.
-- Node JS Modules: Contains modules used by NodeJS to have the program run.
